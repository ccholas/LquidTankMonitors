LiquidTankMonitors
=================

Arduino and Raspberry Pi system for monitoring water tank level and controlling valves to maintain the levels.

The Arduino project monitors the level of the tank via an untrasonic sensor. It reports the level of the tank through 
Xbee to the main controller box that is attached to the main water tank. It takes commands to turn on and off the valve from the main controller.

The Raspberry Pi Project......TBD
